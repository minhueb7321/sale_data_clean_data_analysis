# Sale Data Clean Data Analysis

This repository contains a comprehensive analysis of sales data with a focus on data cleaning and preprocessing techniques. The project showcases my expertise in transforming raw, unstructured sales data into a clean, reliable dataset suitable for in-depth analysis.

## Data Cleaning Process
- **Handling Missing Values**: Identified and imputed missing entries in key fields such as `Customer ID`, `Product ID`, and `Order Date` using statistical methods and domain knowledge.
- **Data Type Correction**: Converted inconsistent data types (e.g., dates, categorical variables) to ensure compatibility with analytical tools.
- **Duplicate Removal**: Detected and eliminated duplicate records to maintain data integrity.
- **Outlier Treatment**: Applied robust statistical techniques to identify and address outliers in `Line Total` and `Unit Price` fields, ensuring accurate insights.
- **Standardization**: Normalized text data (e.g., `Customer Names`, `Region`) and standardized formats for consistency across the dataset.

## Analysis and Insights
After cleaning, the dataset was used to derive actionable insights using Power BI and Python, including sales trends, regional performance, and product profitability.

## Skills Demonstrated
- Proficiency in data cleaning using Python (Pandas, NumPy) and Power Query.
- Strong attention to detail in handling edge cases and ensuring data quality.
- Ability to apply domain-specific logic to enhance data usability.

## Usage
Clone the repository and explore the Jupyter notebooks or Power BI reports for detailed workflows and visualizations.

## Contributions
